## Visualizing Support Vector Machines Using the Iris Dataset 

The iris dataset has a series of response variables that are ideal for data visualization of linear support vector machines. In this example, the data is briefly explored before incoporating some simple coding examples that show how SVM functions and how tuning parameters of the algorithm can be used to make the models simpler or more complex, depending on the data.
